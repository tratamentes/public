<p>If you have ever experienced swollen limbs or discomfort due to lymphedema, lymphatic drainage massage may help you. This gentle massage technique is designed to stimulate the lymphatic system, which can help relieve painful swelling caused by lymphedema. Below is what you need to know about lymphatic drainage massage and how it can benefit your health.</p>
<h2 id="i-overview">I. Overview</h2>
<p>Lymphatic drainage massage, also known as manual lymphatic drainage, is a specialized massage technique that targets the lymphatic system. The goal of lymph drainage massage is to improve the flow of lymph, which may become obstructed due to surgery, injury, or illness. In particular, lymphatic drainage massage is commonly used to relieve swelling and discomfort caused by lymphedema, one of the conditions that can occur, such as after breast cancer surgery.</p>
<h2 id="ii-details-of-the-procedure">II. Details of the procedure</h2>
<p>The lymphatic drainage massage technique involves a two-step process which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>cleansing</li>
<li>reabsorption.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the cleansing phase, the therapist gently massages the lymph nodes to encourage the lymph fluid to move towards the affected area. In the reabsorption phase, the therapist uses light pressure to help the lymphatic system reabsorb the fluid.</p>
<p>Mechanical lymphatic drainage massage devices such as compression pumps can also be used as an alternative to traditional massage techniques, however, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values should be noted as well as heart and respiratory rate, a cardiovascular risk assessment should also be done before using the mechanical pumping system.</p>
<h2 id="iii-risksbenefits">III. Risks/Benefits</h2>
<p>Lymphatic drainage massage is generally considered safe and can provide numerous benefits for those suffering from lymphedema.</p>
<p>With the application of lymphatic drainage massage, there are benefits in the following pathologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lymphedema</li>
<li>Fibromyalgia</li>
<li>Rheumatoid Arthritis</li>
<li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
<li>Migraines</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to make it clear that, despite being a gentle mobilisation technique, there are still some risks associated with lymphatic drainage massage. In some cases, massage can worsen the symptoms of lymphedema, so it may be recommended that you consult the professional who will be applying the manual lymphatic drainage massage before undergoing this treatment.</p>
<p>Lymphatic drainage massage should also be avoided if you have certain health conditions such as active infections, blood clots, heart condition or kidney failure.</p>
<h2 id="iv-recovery-and-outlook">IV. Recovery and Outlook</h2>
<p>After lymphatic drainage massage, you may experience immediate effects such as reduced swelling and pain. Long-term effects may include improved immune function and decreased risk of infection. Your massage therapist may also suggest lymphatic drainage massage techniques that you can apply to yourself in the comfort of your home.</p>
<p>Knowing that the human body functions as an organism with twelve interconnected systems, it is important to monitor your symptoms and inform your lymphatic drainage massage therapist, about its effectiveness in managing your health condition.</p>
<p>If you experience any side effects, such as fever or resurgence of edema with greater intensity it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<h2 id="v-recent-literature-and-medical-advice">V. Recent literature and medical advice</h2>
<p>A quick PubMed search on lymphatic drainage massage methods (Vodder, LeDuc), reveals that this therapeutic approach is undoubtedly an excellent way for those suffering from disorders of the lymphatic and cardiovascular system, such as oedema and lymphedema.</p>
<p>According to the European Portal on Rare Diseases and Orphan Drugs (Orphanet), the prevalence of this disease is 1-5/10 000, making primary lymphoedema one of the rare diseases.</p>
<h2 id="vi-conclusion">VI. Conclusion</h2>
<p>A person can use lymphatic drainage massage techniques to help reduce swelling and improve circulation. An effectively functioning lymphatic system is essential for overall health.</p>
<p>It is important to know that with proper care and treatment, it is possible to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

<p>Do you know that in Portugal at least 1 in 3 people (37%) live with chronic pain?</p>
<p>Chronic pain is a health problem, worldwide, that affects millions of people and can have a major impact on their quality of life.</p>
<p>Living with chronic pain can be challenging as it affects your daily life and social roles.</p>
<p>In the biopsychosocial view, pain management, addresses the psychological and social consequences that chronic pain can have, as well as the importance of considering biological, psychological and social factors in the assessment and treatment of chronic pain. It is well known that chronic pain can affect quality of life, relationships and the ability to perform daily activities.</p>
<p>To better understand the causes of pain it is important to understand the difference between primary and secondary chronic pain for better pain management.</p>
<p>Primary chronic pain is pain that is not caused by any other health condition, but is a condition in itself. For example, chronic headache is a primary pain.</p>
<p>Secondary chronic pain is that which is caused by an underlying health condition, such as arthritis or nerve damage.</p>

<p>It is important to note that some chronic pain can be a sign of a more serious health problem and therefore you should be alert to some of the symptoms such as fever, unexplained weight loss, muscle weakness, changes in sensitivity or progressive and persistent pain. If you experience any of these symptoms you should seek medical attention immediately.</p>
<p>Along with other professionals, such as musculoskeletal therapists (massage therapists, osteopaths, physiotherapists), doctors and pharmacists, psychology also has a role in the treatment of chronic pain, observing case by case and intervening to help the brain communicate in a healthier way with the body, thus reorganising the patient&rsquo;s brain function.</p>
<p>To improve their health, it is essential to change habits and patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p>The individual with chronic pain is an integral part of the process, so it is important that there is communication, with information and guidance, to help them understand the importance of their active participation in the treatment. Their collaboration is fundamental for the success of the treatment, since they are the ones who must perform the tasks and make the changes in their daily lives that contribute to improving their state of health.</p>
<p>Massage has been by choice, a treatment option for chronic pain, in particular for secondary chronic pain.</p>
<p>Based on scientific evidence, massage is indicated by medicine, as a way to relieve pain in most cases. For example, a 2011 study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, another study shows, that after applying massage there is a significant reduction of pain<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For those who suffer on a daily basis with chronic pain, the use of musculoskeletal manual therapy, by a qualified professional is a condition for the relief of pain, in order to restore the functionality of the affected limb or the body in general.</p>
<p>It is always important to mention, that depending on the pain mechanism, there may be a need for a more comprehensive approach, including other health care professionals, with the purpose of supporting chronic pain management.</p>
